# Ball-Simulator

Run Script.py\
This simulator runs with steps. Meaning every step is like a frame in a video.\
\
Ball is an object that moves in a straight line and bounces on a wall and can be eaten.\
Floator is an object that moves at random and can be eaten.\
Black_Hole is an object that is stationary and eats other objects that can be eaten.\
Pulsator is an like a Black_Hole but it shrinks after a certain number of steps but can grow if it eats other objects that can be eaten.\
Hunter is a Black_Hole that can move and seek other objects that can be eaten.\
Special is a Ball that duplicates into other Special objects after a certain number of steps.\
*Be cautious when using Special objects because it is hardware intensive.
